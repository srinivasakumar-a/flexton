The entire world is experiencing Lockdown (partially or wholly) and are confined to their homes. It’s like you have been forced to stay at home and I feel this is the time we need to upgrade our skills, understand our gear, try new compositions and experiments which we could have not achieved in near time.  

If you are into photography, or planning to get into one.  This is the time! Enough of all your procrastination. World’s major photography gear brands are offering Online sessions with a variety of topics.

In this blog post, I shall try to reconcile the online session from the major brands that are offering and the list goes on… Please come to check your area of interest from the brands and topics you wish on the available dates.

Happy Learning :)
