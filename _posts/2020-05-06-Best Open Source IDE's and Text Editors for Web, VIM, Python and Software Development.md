One of the most happening and developer preferred code editor with the following features which are increasing with every new release:

* IntelliSense: Go beyond syntax highlighting and auto complete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions and imported modules.
* Print statement debugging is a thing of the past: Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with breakpoints, call stacks and an interactive console.
* Git commands built-in: Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review differences, stage files and make commits right from the editor. Push and Pull from any hosted SCM service.
* Extensible and Customizable: Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes ensuring they won’t slow down your editor.
* Deploy with confidence and ease: with Microsoft Azure you can deploy and host your React, Angular, Vue, Node, Python (and more!) sites, store and query relational and document based data and scale with serverless computing, all with ease all from within VS Code.

#### Atom
A hackable text editor for the 21st Century. Great things happen when developers work together – from teaching and sharing knowledge to building better software. Teletype for Atom makes collaborating on code just as easy as it is to code alone, right from your editor.
